     * <p>Default 4.0 ships off-axis ON, diverging from the Angelica reference
     * which uses parallel-axis. Angelica's rationale was "asymmetric-frustum
     * gap between eyes" - in practice that artifact appears when the shear is
     * large enough that the LEFT eye's right frustum edge and the RIGHT eye's
     * left frustum edge don't overlap in screen space, leaving a vertical
     * band where each eye only sees one side. At 64mm IPD and 4-block
     * convergence the per-eye shear is ~0.8% of the half-FOV, well under the
     * visible-gap threshold. The default was chosen so first-time users get
     * comfortable depth without having to discover an off-by-default option;
     * users who notice the gap on wide-FOV setups can drop to 0 for
     * parallel-axis behavior matching the reference.
